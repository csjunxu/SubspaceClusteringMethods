=======================
Version: May 24th, 2010

This package contains a Matlab implementation of the Local Subspace Analysis algorithm introduced in the paper

J. Yan and M. Pollefeys
A general framework for motion segmentation: Independent, articulated, rigid, non-rigid, degenerate and non-degenerate
European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 94-106, 2006

The main file of the implementation is lsa.m. The file lsa_test.m prepares and applies the algorithm to a simple subspace clustering problem.
